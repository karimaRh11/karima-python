  # Analysis Criteria
 The data Analysis will be conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries
 manager.
 All the required work from the original data to final versions of data trough scripts,visualizations and final report will be stored in a folder
 named Instacart Basket Analysis_march_2025.
 
 Data will be cleaned from Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns will
 be checked and addressed.
 
 Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.
 Samples will be exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.
 
 Different types of data visualizations clearly labeled will be generated to communicate insights
 to stakeholders.
 
 The Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the
 questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
